# Questions
- My Project 5 features

### Five features of my project are

- My web page is built with React Router DOM. That is why it is possible to navigate multiple routes on a single page on my website without any reload.

- I used the Tailwind CSS framework instead of vanilla CSS for my web pages, which allowed me to do all my design-related tasks without any problems. As a result I have been able to give many attractive designs to my web page. And  I have made my website responsive for all types of devices, so my website will look good on all devices.

- My website is properly a job circular related website. Here users can come and post different types of jobs for their company and other users can bid on those jobs and request job owners.

- I use Firebase for authentication on my website. As a result, a normal user cannot access private routes on my website without login and registration.

- I used json web token to further improve the security of my website. As a result, one user's information cannot be accessed by another user, that is, all the user's personal information cannot be seen by another user.
